  description: Defines a [template](/docs/configuration/templating/#using-value-templates-with-mqtt)

json_attributes_topic:
  description: |-
    The MQTT topic subscribed to receive a JSON dictionary message containing device tracker attributes. This topic can be used to set the location of the device tracker under the following conditions:
    - If the attributes in the JSON message include `longitude`, `latitude`, and `gps_accuracy` (optional).
     - If the device tracker is within a configured [zone](/integrations/zone/).

    If these conditions are met, it is not required to configure `state_topic`.

     Be aware that any location message received at `state_topic`  overrides the location received via `json_attributes_topic` until a message configured with `payload_reset` is received at `state_topic`. For a more generic usage example of the `json_attributes_topic`, refer to the [MQTT sensor](/integrations/sensor.mqtt/#json-attributes-topic-configuration) documentation.

state_topic:
  description: The MQTT topic subscribed to receive device tracker state changes.
    The states defined in `state_topic` override the location states defined by the

    receives a message containing `payload_reset`. The `state_topic` can only be omitted
    if `json_attributes_topic` is used. An empty payload is ignored. Valid payloads
    are `not_home`, `home` or any other custom location or zone name. Payloads for
    `not_home`, `home` can be overridden with the `payload_not_home`and `payload_home`
    config options.
