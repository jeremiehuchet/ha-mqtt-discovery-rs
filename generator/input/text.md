The `mqtt` Text platform allows you to integrate devices that show text that can be set remotely. Optionally the text state can be monitored too using MQTT.

## Configuration

To use an MQTT text entity in your installation, add the following to your `configuration.yaml` file.
{% include integrations/restart_ha_after_config_inclusion.md %}

```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
mqtt:
  - text:
      command_topic: command-topic
```

Alternatively, a more advanced approach is to set it up via [MQTT discovery](/integrations/mqtt/#mqtt-discovery).


âš  Important\
Make sure that your topic matches exactly. `some-topic/` and `some-topic` are different topics.

## Examples

This is an example of a manual configured MQTT `text` item.


```yaml
# Example configuration.yaml entry
mqtt:
  - text:
      name: "Remote LCD screen"
      icon: mdi:ab-testing
      mode: "text"
      command_topic: "txt/cmd"
      state_topic: "txt/state"
      min: 2
      max: 20
```
